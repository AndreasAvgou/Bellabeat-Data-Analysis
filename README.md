# Dataset

We used public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set
contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help
address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.
